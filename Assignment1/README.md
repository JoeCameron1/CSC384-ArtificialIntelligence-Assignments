# Assignment 1 - Implement a Working Solver for the Puzzle Game Sokoban

The assignment handout is 'A1.pdf' above.

To run the test scripts, cd into the assignment folder. 
* Type 'python3 test\_script.py' to run the first test script testing Manhattan Distance, Anytime Greedy Best-First Search, Anytime Weighted A\* Search and the Evaluation Function. Note that the benchmark/expected solution solves 10/10 for Manhattan Distance, 6/10 for Anytime GBFS, 6/10 for Anytime Weighted A\* and 3/3 for the Evaluation Function, given the alotted time. I solve 10/10 for Manhattan Distance, 9/10 for Anytime GBFS, 9/10 for Anytime Weighted A\* and 3/3 for the Evaluation Function,  given the alotted time.
* Type 'python3 test\_script\_alternate.py' to run the second test script testing the Alternate Heuristic. Note that the benchmark/expected solution solves 14/40 for the Alternate Heuristic, given the alotted time. I solve 16/40 for the Alternate Heuristic, given the alotted time.
