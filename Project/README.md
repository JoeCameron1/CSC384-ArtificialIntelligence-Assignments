# Assignment 2 - Constraint Satisfaction

The assignment handout is 'A2.pdf' above.

There are two parts to this assignment:
* The implementation of two constraint propagators – a Forward Checking constraint propagator, and a Generalized Arc Consistence (GAC) constraint propagator.
* The encoding of two different CSP models to solve the logic puzzle, “Tenner Grid”, as described in 'A2.pdf'. In one model I use binary not-equal constraints for row constraints, while in the other model I use n-ary all-different constraints for them.

To run the test scripts, cd into the assignment folder. 
* Type 'python3 csp\_sample\_run.py' to test the constraint satisfaction problems.
* Type 'python3 tenner\_sample\_run.py' to test the Tenner Grid Solver.
